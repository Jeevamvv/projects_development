# Projects Development Automation

This repository contains modular Python automation frameworks for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Zigbee testing.  
It supports Bluetooth profiles such as GAP, OPP, PBAP, A2DP, with scanning, pairing, and media control features.  
Wi-Fi automation covers scanning, connecting, and managing saved networks using NetworkManager.  
Zigbee modules handle device pairing, network joining, and data exchange using standard Zigbee interfaces.  
Structured scripts ensure reusability, logging, and integration with QA workflows for embedded connectivity validation.
